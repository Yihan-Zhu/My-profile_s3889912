					<li>I am especially interested in programming because l like the thinking model of programming languages. It helps me to learn a particular way to solve problems.</li>
					<li>I have learned some basic skills of C Programming language when I was a middle school student. The reason that I decided to study programming in middle school was because my father cultivated my interest in this area when I was very young. Also, I finished a basic internship in HUAWEI company as a student in last long vacation. During that period, I have learned how a workgroup in company solves practical problem. </li>
					<li>Firstly, the second employment rate in Australia of RMIT caught my eye. Secondly, the study area which is IT that l like best of RMIT is also very outstanding in the world. Finally, the RMIT which is a QS 5-star institution can provide great research record and facilities. These are reasons that why I choose RMIT university.</li>
					<li>I expect to lay a good foundation of IT skills during this studying period. Because it may give me good opportunity to access further study for this area that I like best in the future.</li>

				<ul>
				<li>This job is related with network security. It attracts me because I like network areas and I want to do my part in network security in the future. And the international firm is another attractive point for me.</li>
				<li>The job needs related degree such as Computer Science and related technical field and varies of professional working experience in network security areas coding of computer language. So, the programming skill, network security protocols and cryptography knowledge. Meanwhile, it also requires strong teamwork and leadership abilities as a leader in the group.</li>
				<li>For now, I only have some basic understanding of network security and programming languages. And I have some experience of teamwork for specified simple project.</li>
				<li>To achieve the requirements of skills and experience for this ideal job, I decide to divide the plan into different parts which including knowledge acquisition stage and experience accumulation stage. Firstly, the knowledge acquisition stage mainly bases on university learning to obtain the skills. In this stage, I need to have very detailed planning for choosing appropriate course not only in for bachelor’s degree but also for master’s degree in the further because most of professional skills knowledge are coming from the study in university. For this job, I decide to choose bachelor of IT degree and choose courses which are related to network security. And I may choose to go to graduate school for a master’s degree in cybersecurity. Secondly, experience accumulation stage is mainly to get more experience such as company work experience and leadership experience. This stage may cost lots of time and it not easy to find a good chance or job. However, as the proverb goes, “great oaks from little acorns grow.” I will try harder to do every single step.</li>

						<h2 class="wow bounceIn">My ideal project</h2>
						<hr>
					</div>
				<div class = "content1">
					<p>This project is original to build an APP to help personal gourmet or food lover to record and classify delicious food information which including more than the restaurant location and evaluate for restaurant food, the cooking method and food source for home cooking correct to every single dish name. Whenever the ideas come out, then you can directly find where or how to get a delicious food in the restaurant or cooking by yourself. The APP dedicate to help people develop a habit that record and share their experience in specific way not only for the restaurant but also for single dish like food blogger and chef so that every people can become a senior gastronome when you share your experience with your friends or people want to make their life more colourful after a long-term accumulation by using this APP.</p>	
					<p>In this APP, I deicide to provide an innovative way to prepare a big meal for food lover using APP. In the APP, a big meal can be prepared from a detailed idea such a dish name, food name or flavour first, and we can add more details to filtrate the food which we want to eat in the meal. Then it can list all the relevant restaurant and cooking methods sort out by location, waiting time, price of materials or per capita, services, and means of purchase or even more. It maybe looks a little bit mussy, but we can set these screening approach into two main parts. So, the first prat provides the basic function to encourage and help food lover to record the food experience by specific template which including the dish name, restaurant information, location, price, and comments for the restaurant food. Also, in second part, I want to combine the methods way and food sources for home cooking with comments on restaurant food so that people can have more choices at the same time by using this APP. Hence, another plate should be set as cuisine preparation in the APP. This plate plan to add a special template to record the cooking methods with experience and the food source which including different suggestion purchase way, the method of preservation and some tips. To encourage people to use this APP to gather more experience, I decide to add some function such as one-click upload to share the diet information on some mainstream social software which including Tweet, Facebook, Wechat Monments and so on. Meanwhile, I still provide some optional function can be exploited if there are still available time and condition to achieve more functions in this project. For example, I decide to add a healthy diet monitoring function which comes from the project in User-centred design to help people focus on their diet healthy while enjoying the food by using this APP.</p>
					<p>For building the APP, the MIT APP inventor is a good choice for this project. However, there may have some functions in the APP which are not easy to finish by the MIT APP inventor individually. So, the python programming language is also a choice when I make this project. Also, the optional function needs to the data from the User-centre design. To complete this project, a computer and one mobile of IOS or Android are necessary. And some software like Vscode, Github, and MIT APP inventor can make our work more efficient.</p>
					<p>In the process of building the APP, there are some necessary skills which including the basic programming ability for python and be skilled in using MIT APP inventor. For these two skills, the programming ability is one of the skills that we are learning and practice from the university course and the MIT APP inventor is a skill that can be study independently as a student. So, both two necessary skills are not difficulty to hold for basic using. However, it still not easy to be a really proven technique in these areas. It still needs us to work hard and practice constantly for a very long time in the future. By the way, there is another skill that is the skill that we are learning from the university which is User-centre design for optional function in the APP.</p>
					<p>If the project is successful, the best outcome is to give some food lover or gourmet like me a good and more convenient way to record and enrich their experience and daily life by using these APP. Of course, the APP can help to solve most of problems that caused by incommodity. This project is designed for some food lover at the beginning but it also adds elements which can encourage people to develop habit and explore more in the food sector like a real gourmet.</p>

						<p>Myers-Briggs test- this results forecast that my personality, traits, role, strategy in a interesting form. In the results, I am assertive protagonist who is natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. My role could be a diplomat who cares about helping and connecting with others. And my strategy is people mastery which make me seek social contact as well as stimulating and challenging experience.</p>
						<img src = "images/test2.jpg">
						<p>Learning style test- this result shows that I am a visual learner. It prefers to use visual thinking in my daily life.</p>
						<img src = "images/test3.jpg">
						<p>Big five factor- these results show what percentage of trait scores higher than other people who have taken this test. In the graph, the highest score is conscientiousness which is 87. And most of scores are higher than 50 expect the emotional stability which is only 34. It gives intuitionistic comment for different traits so that I can learn more about myself.</p>
						<ul>
						<li></li>
						<li>These results can give me more detailed information that can help me to introduce myself as a group member. I can use these data to introduce my character and preference. Also, these help me to identify my role as a group. For example, I may actively act as a leader when I am in a group according to the first Myers-Briggs test. That may help our group to act more shipshape. And I also do more job like graphic processing and PPT production because I am a visual learner who always use these things in my daily life. Meanwhile, I may need to avoid some jobs which need smooth mood such as argue with other groups because the big five factor test show that my emotional stability is not very good enough.</li>
